# Introduction and motivation

The **Hydro-UQ** application is a 

# Design

Upon completion of this beginner series, you should have the ability to:

- Modify the files and file directories of OpenFOAM
- Modify and setup boundary conditions
- Mesh using blockMesh utilities
- Run OpenFOAM jobs on supercomputing cluster Stampede2
- Be exposed to Agave API and Jupyter notebooks
- Visualize OpenFOAM results using Paraview

# Examples and capabilities

There are several tutorials available on Youtube, particularly concerning the usage of OpenFOAM for CFD. The CFD Notebooks are not an alternative to these video tutorials but as a complementary to the conventional classroom and online Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) courses like ''CFD Python: the 12 steps to Navier-Stokes equations'' [@Barba2019]; and computational fluid mechanics textbooks [@moukalled2015]. The most attractive aspect of the CFD Notebooks is its interface with HPC facilities that are often unavailable with other tutorials and tools.

# Conclusions

The CFD Notebooks are planned to be used in the fluid mechanics' courses at Stanford and UC Berkeley in the coming semester. In addition to the upcoming 2021 tool-training program for researchers in Natural Hazards.
