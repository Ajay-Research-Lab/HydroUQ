# Introduction

In the recent decades, coastal hazards and the damage left behind post-disaster has intensified rapidly. Increases in sea levels globally has lead to more frequent storm surges and tropical cyclones [@Knetal2010], [@Heetel2013], [@Koetal2014]. Storm surges occur when high wind speeds and low pressure areas of tropical cyclones forces the ocean water into the coastal regions. In the recent years, it has been found that the storm surge is related to hurricane intensity, coastal geography, size/speed/angle of approach of the hurricane among other things. There have been many studies investigating the impact of climate change on tropical cyclones and most agree that the maximum wind speeds and minimum pressures will intensify by 5% for every 1 deg-Celsius increase in the tropical ocean temperature [@Em1987]. While storm surges have been of significant importance to the eastern seaboard, tsunamis threaten the pacific coastline. Tsunamis that caused catastropic damage were believed to be once in a century event but not anymore. We have already had three deadly events (Indian ocean 2004, Chile 2010 and Tohoku 2011) in the early part of the 21st century. Each of these caused unprecedented damage to the coastal communities in different parts of the world. 

There has been a uptick in the number of residents in the coastal areas and this is expected to rise. Thus, it is more important than ever before to be able to comprehensively understand their impact on the coastal communities. In this regard, the disaster reconnaissance investigations of previous events has proved useful and provided ways to understand and improve the scientific understanding of these extreme events. However, the grand challenge today [@StateArtRepo2021], [@SCPaper2020], [@RAPID2020] is to being able to model hazards probabilistically and predict the risk to the urban environment and community. Such probabilitic high-fidelity tools are much necessary in order to evaluate decisions that enhance overall community resilience.

The **HydroUQ** is an open-source cloud-based application that provides researchers a tool to assess the performance of a building or specimen subjected to wave loading during natural hazard events, namely tsunami and storm surge . 




The tool facilitates a multiscale coupling by resolving areas of interest by coupling two-dimensional shallow water solver (GeoClaw) with three-dimensional CFD solver (OpenFOAM) through an interchangeable workflow.

The tool facilitates researchers to consider:

Bathymetry/topography of the ocean floor
Shallow-water solutions as boundary conditions
User-defined buildings
UQ methods like forward propagation, sensitivity and reliability analysis
Building models include MDOF, steel building model and OpenSees models
In addition, the tool specifically allows for modeling of experiments from wave flumes (for example, the NHERI Experimental Facility at Oregon State University). The outputs of the HydroUQ include probabilistic building responses, velocities and pressure at any point in the fluid domain.

These simulations are computationally demanding and thus, users have the option to perform the computations on the Stampede2 supercomputer. Stampede2 is located at the Texas Advanced Computing Center and made available to the user through NSF's NHERI DesignSafe, the cyberinfrastructure provider for NHERI.




is a set of Jupyter notebooks aimed at senior undergraduate and early graduate students interested in learning OpenFOAM. It aims to allow the learner to get started with the open-source CFD tool OpenFOAM and run it on Designsafe. It provides a foundation for all aspects of OpenFOAM, from running cases to programming, so it is useful to both new users and existing users wishing to broaden their basic knowledge of OpenFOAM. The learners are exposed to running exercises and simulating OpenFOAM cases using an HPC computing platform, accessed directly through the Jupyter notebook. The Jupyter notebooks consist of video tutorials, DIY examples, and general reading materials. This learning tool is truly platform-independent and leverages the power of HPC. At present, CFD Notebooks are hosted and uses Designsafe's supercomputing infrastructure at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, particularly the Stampede2 and Frontera clusters.

The notebooks are broken up into various editions, each with four lessons: Beginner / Intermediate / Expert / Professional. At present, only the beginner edition is available. The beginner edition of the notebook includes four lessons:

* Lesson 1 (Introduction to OpenFOAM and Designsafe): Introduces the learner to the basic structure of OpenFOAM and Designsafe cyberinfrastructure. 

* Lesson 2 (Different solvers in OpenFOAM and which to use?): Helps learners identify different types of solvers in OpenFOAM (laminar vs. turbulent; steady-state vs. transient).

* Lesson 3 (Boundary conditions in OpenFOAM): While the number of boundary conditions is several, the lesson introduces the learner to the basic boundary conditions and their meaning.

* Lesson 4 (Meshing in OpenFOAM (blockMesh)): The lesson introduces the learner to blockMesh utility basics in OpenFOAM.

Additionally, CFD-Notebooks are accompanied by an extensive theoretical [documentation](https://nheri-simcenter.github.io/CFD-Notebooks/) and [user forum](http://simcenter-messageboard.designsafe-ci.org/smf/index.php?board=11.0) to provide hands-on support.

# Features and design

THE CFD Notebooks are a series of Jupyter notebooks that include video tutorials, DIY examples, and exercises. Furthermore, sample problems are also provided on the [documentation](https://nheri-simcenter.github.io/CFD-Notebooks/) site.

Four primary aspects facilitate the learner to access and use OpenFOAM on DesignSafe. This starts with login and authentication. Designsafe account acts as authentication to access the HPC resources at TACC. This is achieved through an Agave API client. 

```python
from agavepy.agave import Agave
ag = Agave.restore()
ag.profiles.get()
```

Once authenticated, the learners can access all the apps and software available for public users on TACC. TACC classifies software (or `apps`) as `public` and `private`. `private` refers to the custom `apps` created by users and can be accessed only if permitted by the user who has created it. In contrast, `public` refers to those that are accessible to all users. The learners can access the list of `apps` and choose the particular version of OpenFOAM of interest. This reduces the requirement to install OpenFOAM on the local computer and facilitates access to the same version anytime. This is achieved again through the Agave API client's usage, which loads the OpenFOAM version of interest.

```python
ag.apps.list()
app = ag.apps.get(appId = 'openfoam-7.0u3')
app.parameters

```

Once the OpenFOAM version of interest is loaded, the job parameters can be provided in a JSON format shown below. This helps TACC HPC automatically generate a runtime script to submit, run, and facilitate the job.

```python
jobdetails = {
	"name": "OpenFOAM-Demo", #Name of job
	"appId": "openfoam-7.0u3", #OpenFOAM version to be used
	"maxRunTime": "00:02:00", #Clock time to run the job
	"nodeCount": 1, #Number of nodes
	"processorsPerNode": 1, #Number of processors (Max 64 per node)
	"archive": True, #To add results to archive folder
	"archiveSystem": "designsafe.storage.default",
	"parameters": {
        "mesh": "On", #Use blockMesh or snappyHexMesh?
        "decomp": "Off", #Use parallelization?
        "solver": "simpleFoam" #Solver to be used?
    },
	"inputs": {
		"inputDirectory": "agave://designsafe.storage.published// \
                       PRJ-2915/examples/pitzDaily" 
                      #Where are the care directories located?
		}
}
job = ag.jobs.submit(body=jobdetails)
```

The OpenFOAM simulation can be monitored both on the [Designsafe-ci](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/) dashboard or through the CFD Jupyter Notebook. Using the status commands, it can be easily determined with a job has been `QUEUED`, `ACCEPTED`, `RUNNING` or `COMPLETED`.

```python
from agavepy.async import AgaveAsyncResponse
asrp = AgaveAsyncResponse(ag,job)
asrp.status
```
