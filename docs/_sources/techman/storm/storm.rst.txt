Storm Surge
================

Storm surge can be defined as the abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted astronomical tides. Flooding from storm surge depends on several factors, including track, intensity, size, and forward speed of the hurricane and the characteristics of the coastline where it comes ashore or passes nearby. The below screenshot is obtained from the map generated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It shows the storm surge inundation map obtained from the SLOSH numerical model. It shows the vulnerable points on the Eastern US coast that are significantly vulnerable to inundation heights of up to 9 feet.

   This map displays the results from SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) model. SLOSH is a numerical model used by NWS (National Weather Service) to compute storm surge.
