Software Architecture
========================

The SimCenter is developing a software framework for building applications that run scientific workflow applications to perform computational simulations in field of NHE at both building level scale and regionsl scale. It is releasing a number of applications built using this framework. The WE-UQ app is one of those applications which have been released (EE-UQ, WE-UQ, PBE). Other applications are under development (RDT). The applications that the SimCenter are developing are limited scientific workflow systems. This chapter presents the software architecture for the framework and the WE-UQ app built using it using the C4 model. The following sections present the architecture to level 3:
